                <p>Flakey cod in a tomato and olive sauce is an easy recipe to make for dinner this week, and an absolute must-make if you’re looking for new ways to eat fish. The cod comes out tender and melts in your mouth, and is packed with so much flavor.

                    Cod fillets are seasoned with a little salt, pepper and Italian seasoning, then cooked in a simple tomato sauce made from canned whole tomatoes, sauteed shallots and garlic, olives and a few spices.

                    The fish comes out so tender and flavorful, and is delicious paired with roasted potatoes or pearl couscous and a simple side salad.
